# Skylin

Skylin is an open source Electron-base app for decentralized file uploading/downloading on the skynet/sia network.

![Skylin Screenshot](./assets/readme-bg.png)

It is written in Javascript and uses React.
Skylin allows you to upload files to skynet with symmetric/asymmetric (openPGP) encryption and more.
It's an independent project with its ongoing development.

## Notes
- Skylin is for the moment only compatible with macOS
- PGP private keys are totally secure since they are encrypted with a passphrase that only you have in mind.
- There will soon be a global optimization of the app architecture.
